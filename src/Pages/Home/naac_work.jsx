          Teachers are like our friends and they do anything for the student's
          welfare. They teach for placement along with the academic syllabus.
          The calm and greenish environment make us to think differently. The
          homely atmosphere of hostel and food facilities give us a thought of
          our own place. Totally, our college is a place to learn more, grow
          more and achieve more. I thank all of you for supporting and
          encouraging me and for providing placement opportunities.
